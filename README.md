## duct++ â€” it's the bee's knees

**duct++** is a general-purpose C++11 header library which supplies:

* Compiler and platform detection macros.
* Debug message and assertion macros.
* Endian byte-swapping.
* Unicode encoding and string conversion helpers.
* `iostream` helpers for binary and textual data (integrates with the C++
  Standard Library).
* Generic token parsing.
* CVar-esque system with validation, and a markup language.

All it needs is a shiny C++11-compliant compiler and standard library.
That's not too much to ask for, is it? *Is it, Microsoft?*

## Building

Being a header library, duct++ is not compiled directly. However, all features
support Clang 3.3+ with libc++ (SVN head). GCC with libstdc++ is only partially
supported (as of 4.7.3) due to issues in ISO compliance (see *Defects* below).

The tests can be compiled using plash's standard project protocol:

## Defects

The following headers require corrections in libstdc++ (4.7.3):

1. `<duct/IO/multistream.hpp>`:
   `std::vector<T>::assign()` is missing the rvalue ref variant.

## License

duct++ carries the MIT license, meaning you can do whatever you want to with it.
