## duct++ ain't ya papa's cup'a tea

**duct++** is a general-purpose C++11 header library which supplies:

* Compiler and platform detection macros
* Debug message and assertion macros
* Endian byte-swapping
* Unicode encoding and string conversion helpers
* `iostream` helpers for binary and textual data
* Generic token parsing
* CVar-esque system with validation, and a markup language

All it wants is a shiny C++11-compliant compiler. That's not too much to ask for, is it? Is it, Microsoft?
