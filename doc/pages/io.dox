@warning All I/O functions defined here are "unsafe" in that they do not check stream state when executing operations; they assume a @c stream.good()==true state on entry and cannot guarantee it on return. @c ios::badbit and/or @c ios::failbit may be set on the stream after the operation has executed; see std::basic_istream::read() and std::basic_ostream::write().
