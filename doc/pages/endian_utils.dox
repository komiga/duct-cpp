@note The @c byte_swap() functions:

-# are only usable with 2, 4, and 8 byte-sized arithmetic types (integral and floating-point types; see @c std::is_arithmetic); a 1-byte immediate-return implementation is defined for convenience
-# may be system-optimized for integral types (where @c <byteswap.h> is present)
